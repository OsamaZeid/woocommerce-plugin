Accept payments with the Tazapay gateway.

== Description ==
The Tazapay escrow API allows you as a marketplace partner to create accounts, share information about an underlying contact between two parties as well as to collect, hold and receive payments between multiple parties.

For each transaction, the Marketplace creates an underlying escrow agreement between the buyer and seller. This agreement becomes the legal basis for collecting, holding and releasing money.

We are constantly working on our API product to make it easier for our partners to integrate with us. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please share them with us at techops@tazapay.com
